This app will have three backend APIs:

- [ ] One to get all videos from the YouTube API
- [ ] One to edit and store all the users' content 
- [ ] One to fetch the content from the database 

## User story

A user searches AFTV videos, then chooses one they like. The user would like to be able to select a segment of the video and either turn it into a video/GIF/picture. The user should be able to add text to the context and save the post. Users should also be able to see all other posts created.
